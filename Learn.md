# Learning Through Project

Take Online Notes project that is easy to use and to understand. I created this website while learning Frontend Development. 
I used all the basic concepts of React JS (components, props and hooks) in this project, and my project will help learners to 
understand the basic concepts of React JS and implementation of the concepts. Records of notes are maintained and saved through **Local Storage**. 
I hosted this website using the Azure Static Web Apps service.
